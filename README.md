# Spatial Differentiation of Real Estate Prices
This repository contains code and data I used for my 4th year of study term paper  
Poznan.ipynb contains an example of analysis I conducted for all four researched cities (Poznan, Gdansk, Leipzig, Hannover)
All other gpkg files are data on realty prices aggregated either by H3 hexagons, or by neighbourhoods.
